If a website file is modified and the filesize does not match your backed up file filesize then the file will be autorestored with AutoRestore and a copy of that modified file will also be sent to Quarantine. If a new file is uploaded to your website and a copy of that uploaded file does not exist in backup then that file is sent to Quarantine. Quarantine has 3 options for files that have been quarantined. 1. View File, 2. Restore File or 3. Delete File. If a file is sent to the Quarantine folder due to user error then it can be quickly and easily restored by selecting the Restore File option. ARQ Infinity includes all the tools you will need to perform any action you need - backing up files to backup, deleting files from backup, adding additional website files and excluding files from being checked by the ARQ Cron. You should NEVER manually (FTP or Web Host Control Panel) change, modify, move, upload or delete any files in backup. ARQ Infinity is utilizing your database to perform some tasks so if you manually (FTP or Web Host Control Panel) change any files in backup then this could result in serious website problems. All the tools you need are included in ARQ Infinity and you should not have to do anything manually with backup files.', 'bulletproof-security').'<br><br><strong>'.__('Quick Setup Steps for manual setup of AutoRestore (The BPS Pro Setup Wizard does all of these setup steps automatically)', 'bulletproof-security').'</strong><br>'.__('1.

Example: You are modifying several of your Theme files. You have a Top Level WordPress Folder named /xxxxx/xxxxx/', 'bulletproof-security').$bps_wpcontent_dir.__('/themes/my-theme and you want to exclude all subfolders and files from being checked by the ARQ Cron while you are modifying your Theme files. You would select the Exclude Top Level Folder option and then enter the folder path to this folder /xxxxx/xxxxx/', 'bulletproof-security').$bps_wpcontent_dir.__('/themes/my-theme in the Enter an Exclude Folder or File Path text box and click the Exclude button. After you are done modifying your Theme files you would FIRST backup your files by going to the AutoRestore|Quarantine Settings page and clicking the Backup Files button for the wp-content folder and then use the Remove Excluded Folders|Files Search tool to find and remove these files from being excluded from the ARQ Cron check.', 'bulletproof-security').'<br><br><strong>'.__('Remove Folders & Files General Concept', 'bulletproof-security').'</strong><br>'.__('When you Add or Exclude Folders and Files those individual file paths are added to your WordPress database. Using the Remove Folders & Files search tools lets you search your WordPress database for these folder and file paths that you want to remove from your DB. There are 2 separate search tools for searching: 1. Remove Added Folders|Files Search & 2. Remove Excluded Folders|Files Search. Your Search Results are displayed in a Radio Button Form with 2 options. 1. Remove. or 2. Do Not Remove next to each search result returned. Since the Remove Folders & Files Search tools are searching your database you can use very general search terms. For example to search for all php files that you have Added or Excluded you would search for .php. For all text files you would search for .txt. To search for a particular folder name you would type in that folder name without having to add a folder path. If you type in a single forward slash "/" as your search then all database entries will be shown in either the Added Files database Table or Excluded Files database Table because all database entries contain paths that have a forward slash in them.', 'bulletproof-security').'<br><br><strong>'.__('Remove Added Folders|Files Search', 'bulletproof-security').'</strong><br>'.__('Your Search Results are displayed in a Radio Button Form with 2 options. 1.
